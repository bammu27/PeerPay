Building a **peer-to-peer loan lending platform as a mobile app** integrated with **decentralized identity (DID)** requires careful planning, choice of technologies, and documentation. Below is a roadmap, key technologies, and a guide to creating a comprehensive **Software Development Document (SDD)**.

---

## **Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Planning & Requirements**
1. **Define Core Features**:
   - User registration and authentication (DID integration).
   - Loan management system: request, approve, and repay loans.
   - Wallet integration for transactions.
   - Document storage and digital signatures.
   - Push notifications for loan requests and approvals.

2. **Research Technologies**:
   - DID frameworks: e.g., **Sovrin, uPort, or Ethereum ENS**.
   - Smart contract platforms: **Ethereum, Polygon, or Solana**.
   - Cross-platform mobile frameworks: **Flutter, React Native**.

3. **Design System Architecture**:
   - Frontend: Mobile app (React Native/Flutter).
   - Backend: Node.js with Express or Flask/Django for APIs.
   - Blockchain: Smart contracts in Solidity for Ethereum/Polygon.
   - Decentralized Identity: DID methods and verifiable credentials.
   - Storage:
     - **IPFS** for document storage.
     - **MongoDB** for app metadata.

4. **Create Mockups**:
   - Design UI/UX using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.
   - Ensure user-friendly interfaces for borrowers and lenders.

### **Phase 2: Development**
#### **Step 1: Decentralized Identity Integration**
- Use DID libraries:
  - **Ethereum DID Registry** or **uPort** for self-sovereign identity.
  - Implement **Verifiable Credentials** for identity validation.
- Integrate DID-based authentication:
  - Enable users to prove identity without sharing sensitive data.

#### **Step 2: Blockchain Smart Contracts**
- Develop Solidity contracts for:
  - Loan creation and repayment.
  - Wallet interactions for lending and borrowing.
- Test with **Ganache** and deploy on **testnets** (e.g., Goerli, Mumbai).

#### **Step 3: Mobile App**
- Develop with:
  - **React Native** for JavaScript developers.
  - **Flutter** for Dart-based development.
- Integrate Web3 for blockchain connectivity:
  - Use **ethers.js** or **Web3.js** libraries.

#### **Step 4: Backend APIs**
- Build APIs to:
  - Store user profiles and metadata.
  - Manage notifications.
  - Facilitate DID issuance and validation.

#### **Step 5: Testing**
- Conduct **unit testing**, **integration testing**, and **load testing**.
- Use tools like **Jest**, **Mocha**, and **Postman** for API testing.

---

### **Phase 3: Deployment**
- Deploy the app to **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store**.
- Deploy smart contracts to the mainnet.
- Use **AWS** or **Google Cloud** for backend hosting and IPFS gateways.

---

### **Phase 4: Maintenance**
1. Regular updates for smart contracts (if needed).
2. Continuous monitoring of DID systems.
3. Ensure compliance with data privacy laws like **GDPR**.

## **Technologies Involved**

### **Frontend**
- **React Native** or **Flutter** for mobile app.
- **Web3.js** or **ethers.js** for blockchain interaction.
- **Expo** for quick testing and deployment.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js** with Express or Python Flask/Django.
- **MongoDB** for storing metadata.
- **Redis** for caching and quick lookup.

### **Blockchain**
- **Ethereum/Polygon** for smart contracts.
- **Solidity** for contract development.
- **Truffle/Hardhat** for testing and deploying contracts.

### **Storage**
- **IPFS** for decentralized document storage.
- **AWS S3** (if hybrid storage is needed).

### **Decentralized Identity**
- DID libraries:
  - **did-jwt** and **ethr-did-resolver**.
  - Frameworks like **uPort** or **SSI frameworks**.
- Verifiable credentials standards:
  - **W3C Verifiable Credentials**.

### **Notification Service**
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications.

## **Software Development Document (SDD)**

A comprehensive SDD helps structure the development process. Below is an outline:

### **1. Introduction**
- Purpose of the app.
- Goals of the project (e.g., decentralized, transparent P2P lending).
- Stakeholders (e.g., borrowers, lenders, admins).

### **2. System Overview**
- **Architecture Diagram**:
  - Mobile app, backend, blockchain, and storage interaction.
- High-level workflow (e.g., user registration → loan request → approval → repayment).

### **3. Functional Requirements**
- User roles:
  - Borrower: View lenders, request loans, sign contracts.
  - Lender: Approve loans, set rates, and terms.
- Key features:
  - DID-based authentication.
  - Loan management system.
  - Notifications.

### **4. Non-Functional Requirements**
- Security:
  - Smart contract audits.
  - DID encryption for sensitive data.
- Performance:
  - Support for 10,000+ users.
- Availability:
  - 99.9% uptime for APIs and smart contracts.

### **5. Technology Stack**
- Details of each technology:
  - **Frontend**: React Native, Web3.js.
  - **Backend**: Node.js, MongoDB.
  - **Blockchain**: Ethereum, IPFS.

### **6. Data Models**
- **User Profile**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "did": "did:ethr:0x123...",
    "job": "Engineer",
    "location": "New York",
    "walletBalance": 1000
  }
  ```
- **Loan Agreement**:
  ```json
  {
    "loanId": "456",
    "borrowerId": "123",
    "lenderId": "789",
    "amount": 500,
    "interestRate": 10,
    "duration": 30,
    "status": "active"
  }
  ```

### **7. API Endpoints**
- **POST /register**: Create a new user.
- **GET /users**: List all lenders.
- **POST /loan/request**: Request a loan.
- **POST /loan/approve**: Approve a loan.

### **8. Smart Contract Details**
- **Functions**:
  - `createLoan(address borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate, uint duration)`.
  - `repayLoan(uint loanId)`.
- **Events**:
  - `LoanCreated`.
  - `LoanRepaid`.

### **9. Testing Plan**
- Unit tests for smart contracts.
- Integration tests for DID and blockchain interactions.
- UI tests for app usability.

### **10. Deployment Strategy**
- Deploy smart contracts on testnet/mainnet.
- Mobile app distribution via App Stores.
