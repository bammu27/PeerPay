# **Software Development Document (SDD)**

## **1. Introduction**
This document outlines the development process for a **Peer-to-Peer Loan Lending Platform**. The platform enables users to lend and borrow money securely using **decentralized identity (DID)** and **blockchain technology** for transactions.

### **Purpose**
To create a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform where individuals can lend and borrow money directly, with smart contracts ensuring compliance with terms.

### **Goals**
- Integrate decentralized identity for user authentication.
- Enable automatic loan repayment through smart contracts.
- Provide a user-friendly mobile application.

### **Stakeholders**
- **Borrowers**: Users seeking loans.
- **Lenders**: Users offering loans.
- **Admins**: Monitor the platform for compliance.

---

## **2. System Overview**
### **Architecture**
The system consists of:
- **Frontend**: Mobile app for borrowers and lenders.
- **Backend**: API for DID authentication and loan management.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum smart contracts for loan agreements.
- **Storage**: IPFS for storing digital documents.

### **Workflow**
1. Users register with name, job, location, and verified ID (Aadhaar, PAN).
2. Borrowers view lenders with loan terms.
3. Borrowers send loan requests; lenders receive notifications.
4. Upon approval, a digital document is signed and stored.
5. Smart contracts manage transactions and repayments.

---

## **3. Functional Requirements**
### **User Roles**
- **Borrower**:
  - View lenders and loan terms.
  - Request loans.
  - Sign loan agreements.
- **Lender**:
  - Approve/reject loan requests.
  - Set interest rates and loan terms.
- **Admin**:
  - Monitor transactions and user activities.

### **Features**
- DID-based authentication.
- Loan management system (request, approval, repayment).
- Notifications for loan requests and approvals.
- Digital document generation with signatures.

---

## **4. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Security**:
  - Smart contract audits to prevent vulnerabilities.
  - DID encryption for sensitive data.
- **Performance**:
  - Handle 10,000+ active users efficiently.
- **Availability**:
  - 99.9% uptime for APIs and blockchain services.

---

## **5. Technology Stack**
### **Frontend**
- **React Native**: Mobile app development.
- **Web3.js**: Blockchain interaction.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js** with Express: RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: User data storage.

### **Blockchain**
- **Ethereum/Polygon**: Smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: Contract programming.

### **Storage**
- **IPFS**: Decentralized document storage.
- **AWS S3**: Backup storage (optional).

### **Decentralized Identity**
- **DID Libraries**: did-jwt, ethr-did-resolver.
- **Frameworks**: uPort, Sovrin.

### **Notifications**
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**.

---

## **6. Data Models**
### **User Profile**
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "did": "did:ethr:0x123...",
  "job": "Engineer",
  "location": "New York",
  "walletBalance": 1000
}
```

### **Loan Agreement**
```json
{
  "loanId": "456",
  "borrowerId": "123",
  "lenderId": "789",
  "amount": 500,
  "interestRate": 10,
  "duration": 30,
  "status": "active"
}
```

---

## **7. API Endpoints**
### **Authentication**
- `POST /register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /login`: Authenticate a user with DID.

### **Loan Management**
- `GET /users`: List all lenders.
- `POST /loan/request`: Borrower requests a loan.
- `POST /loan/approve`: Lender approves a loan.

### **Notifications**
- `POST /notify`: Send loan request/approval notifications.

---

## **8. Smart Contract Details**
### **Functions**
- `createLoan(address borrower, uint amount, uint interestRate, uint duration)`
- `approveLoan(uint loanId)`
- `repayLoan(uint loanId)`

### **Events**
- `LoanCreated(address lender, address borrower, uint amount)`
- `LoanRepaid(uint loanId)`

---

## **9. Testing Plan**
### **Unit Testing**
- Verify smart contract logic (e.g., loan creation, repayment).

### **Integration Testing**
- DID and blockchain interaction.
- Loan request and approval workflows.

### **UI Testing**
- Mobile app usability and responsiveness.

---

## **10. Deployment Strategy**
### **Blockchain Deployment**
- Deploy smart contracts on **Ethereum** or **Polygon** mainnet.

### **Mobile App**
- Publish on **Google Play Store** and **Apple App Store**.

### **Backend Hosting**
- Use **AWS** or **Google Cloud** for REST APIs and DID services.

---

## **11. Maintenance**
- Regular updates for the smart contracts.
- Monitor API and DID services for uptime.
- Handle bugs and user feedback promptly.

---

## **Appendix**
### **Tools**
- **Truffle/Hardhat**: Smart contract development.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain testing.
- **Figma**: UI/UX design.
- **Postman**: API testing.
